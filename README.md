## **Introduction:**

Nowadays, the suistainability in the bussiness market is not only a reality, it's mandatory to implement a Carbon Neutral roadmap and implement different accionts to achieve the Zero Emmission compromise. Cabify is leader of the Spanish market making this compensation for years but now the Companies are really interested in knowing as much information as possible. 

## **Status:**

At the moment, holdings are facing the following issues: 

- A holding is not capable of view all of the companies that belongs to the same group at the same time, it's necessary to login one by one
- The platform is not showing the Kgs of CO2 at any level but Cabify has all the data collected. 

## **Dashboard Solution:**

The dashboard that I've designed is solving both issues at the same time. On one side, it generates the data of a specific holding and, on the other hand, it presents the Kgs of CO2 in different situations requested by clients. 

## **Data Model:**

## **Dashboard Data:**

The Dashboard created for this project contains the following information:
